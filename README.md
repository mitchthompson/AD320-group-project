BookSwap is an online lending library where users can trade books with one another and list books that they are willing to loan out. 
Users can sign up for a free account, and once authenticated, can browse a large library of books while sharing with others.

BookSwap is a MySQL database driven web application with CRUD and REST integration on both server and client side and utilizes API data from Open Library (https://openlibrary.org).
