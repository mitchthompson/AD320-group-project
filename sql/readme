These are the files to create the database and the EER model.
According to the data format at: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books
the 'bib_key' can use many different identifiers as keys to look up books, so 
currently this uses the 'isbn' identifier as primary key to keep things simple, which
can be coded to be used by the bib_key. Either the ISBN 10 or 13 may be used.
